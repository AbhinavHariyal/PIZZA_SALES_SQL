# KEY FEATURES:
1. Data collection
2. Data visualization 
3. Sales aggregation
4. Top-selling items
5. Sales trends

# Advantages 
1. Efficient Data Querying and Aggregation: SQL allows for quick and efficient querying of large datasets, making it ideal for analyzing extensive sales data. You can easily aggregate data (e.g., total sales, average revenue per pizza, sales by location) using SQLâ€™s built 
   in functions like SUM(), AVG(), and GROUP BY, which helps generate insights in real-time without manually sifting through data.
2.  Complex Query Capability: SQL enables complex queries and joins across multiple tables, allowing deep insights into various aspects of pizza sales, customer preferences, and trends.
3.  Data Integrity and Accuracy: SQL databases ensure data integrity through constraints, normalization, and structured data relationships (e.g., foreign keys), ensuring that your analysis is built on consistent and accurate data. This reduces the risk of errors during 
   analysis, ensuring more reliable results for decision-making.
